 In the recent past, research has been done in producing scheduling transformations for a mix of recursion and loops, and in our prior work PolyRec we have addressed how to compose, apply, and reason about the soundness of these transformations. In our current work, we introduce UniRec, an extension of PolyRec that incorporates skewing for recursion. In this talk, I will be mainly focusing on major challenges in the representation of iteration spaces and transformations, the composition of transformations, and checking the soundness of composed transformations when we try to incorporate skewing.
