 Distributed systems are so integral to the technology that underpins our daily lives that many people often forget they are there. Due to their ubiquity, distributed systems are an important subject for formal verification. However, many common properties of realistic distributed systems, such as large variable domains and arbitrary numbers of interacting processes, make them challenging verification targets. In this talk, I will review techniques for modeling multi-process systems and discuss methods for handling unboundedness in verifying parameterized distributed systems.
