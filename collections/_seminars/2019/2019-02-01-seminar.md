There has been progress in applying machine learning techniques to symbolic reasoning (such
as SAT, QBF, and SMT solving), showing various approaches to combine the power of stochastic op-
timization with symbolic decision procedures. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of learn-
ing GNN (Graph Neural Network) based solvers and GNN-based heuristics for 2QBF (Quantified
Boolean Formula) problems. We design and evaluate several GNN architectures for 2QBF formu-
lae, and conjecture with empirical support that GNN has certain limitations in learning 2QBF
solvers, primarily due to the inability to reason about âˆ€ quantifiers or to prove unsatisfiability of
SAT problems. We then show success in learning heuristics for a CEGAR-based 2QBF solver,
and compare our learned heuristics with known MaxSAT based heuristics. We further explore
generalizing GNN-based heuristics to larger unseen instances, and uncover interesting challenges
in generalization across graph structures. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive sur-
veying view of applying GNN-embeddings to 2QBF solvers, and aims to offer guidance in apply-
ing ML to more complicated symbolic reasoning problems.
