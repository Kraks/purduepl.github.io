Apache Cassandra is a distributed columnar store that provides elastic scalability and strong availability. As more and more NoSQL and NewSQL databases emerge toady to serve the needs of big data and data intensive applications, there are still many application use-cases that would benefit or could be simplified by the availability of transactions. 

ACID has been the good old standard for transactions on relational database management systems for many years. In this talk we will describe in detail a method for bring ACID-compliant, transactional support to Cassandra via optimistic concurrency control algorithms.
