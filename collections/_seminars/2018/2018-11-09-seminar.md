 Dependent types are a powerful tool for maintaining
 non-trivial invariants, while control operators are a useful facility
 for implementing sophisticated behaviors.  It is known that having
 both in a single language requires a purity restriction on type
 dependency, i.e., types may depend only on pure terms.  In this talk,
 I show how to incorporate Danvy and Filinski's shift and reset
 operators into a dependently typed language.  The main finding is that
 the flexibility of shift and reset gives rise to new kinds of
 problematic type dependency, namely dependency of and on
 continuations.
