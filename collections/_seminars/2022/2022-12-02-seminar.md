Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis and testing technique.
Symbolic execution engines are usually implemented as interpreters, and the
induced interpretation overhead can dramatically inhibit performance.
Instrumentation is another popular implementation choice with limited ability
to transform programs. However, the use of compilation and code generation
techniques beyond simple instrumentation for engine construction remains
underexplored, and leaves potential performance gains untapped.

In this talk, I'm going to talk about improving the performance of symbolic
execution via sophisticated compilation techniques. The key insight is to
compile symbolic execution tasks into cooperative concurrency via
continuation-passing style, which completely eliminates interpretation overhead
and further enables efficient parallelism. I will also present GenSym, the
symbolic-execution compiler we build for LLVM's IR based on partial evaluation
to continuation-passing code. We evaluate the performance of GenSym and compare
with KLEE (the state-of-the-art symbolic interpreter for LLVM IR), which shows
significant speedups on several Coreutils programs.
