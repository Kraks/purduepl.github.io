Hoare-style program logics are a popular and effective technique for software
verification. Relational program logics are an instance of this approach that
enables reasoning about relationships between the execution of two or more
programs. Existing relational program logics have focused on verifying that
all runs of a collection of programs do not violate a specified relational
behavior. Several important relational properties, including refinement and
noninterference, do not fit into this category, as they also mandate the
existence of specific desirable executions. This talk presents
RHLE, a logic for verifying these sorts of relational ∀∃ properties.
Key to our approach is a novel form of function specification that employs a
variant of ghost variables to ensure that valid implementations exhibit
certain behaviors. This is a practice talk for APLAS 2022.
