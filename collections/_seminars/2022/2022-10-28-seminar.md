Setup: The goal of this week’s seminar is to help everyone hone their story for the (rapidly approaching) PLDI deadline next month! Interested speakers should put together a short, two-minute (max) elevator pitch for their work (think of this as a longish abstract for your paper). Everyone will take turns pitching their paper, and the audience will offer friendly feedback / questions on the pitch.

Q: What is an elevator pitch?
A: It’s a short, memorable description of the problem you’re trying to solve and a high-level overview of your solution. The goal is to spark interest and, ideally, a longer conversation.
