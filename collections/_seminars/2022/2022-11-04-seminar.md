Moving identical computations to common successors or predecessors to reduce code size or improve performance is the basic design principle in classical compiler optimizations like Tail Merging and Code Sinking/Hoisting. These transformations only exploit instruction similarity at the basic block level and require identical instruction sequences to be present, making them less useful in real applications. However, real-world programs contain much more similar (non-identical) instruction sequences within control-flow regions. In this work, we propose Control-flow Melding (CFM), a more general version of tail merging that can merge control-flow at the region level. CFM â€™s hierarchical region and instruction alignment approach ensures that it can exploit code similarity maximally to reduce code size and/or improve performance. We implement CFM as LLVM-IR transformation pass and evaluate its effectiveness in reducing control-flow divergence in GPU programs and reducing code size in CPU programs. Our evaluation shows that CFM is effective as a general compiler transformation pass and worthy of being integrated into a modern compiler pipeline.
