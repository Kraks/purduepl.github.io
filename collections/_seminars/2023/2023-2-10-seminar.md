The success of Rust has spurred the development of substructural
features in higher-level languages (e.g., Scala, OCaml, D, Swift),
offering tremendous potential for safe low-level memory management and
controlling resources/capabilities. However, adapting Rust techniques
to higher-level settings has been difficult due to conflicts with
effects, higher-order functions, polymorphic types, and other forms of
abstraction.

The recent reachability types proposal [1,2] based on a versatile and
scalable substrate inspired by separation logic, promises to remove
these obstacles and make lifetimes and sharing an integral part of
mainstream high-level programming. This talk will give a tour of the
initial proposal [1] and present an ongoing effort to smoothly scale
the system to polymorphism and data types in the new lambda-diamond
and F-sub-diamond calculi.
