The CIVL verifier allows the construction of safety proofs for concurrent programs across multiple layers of refinement. Each refinement step focuses on a small simplifying program transformations, making proofs more manageable and reusable, and specifically eliminating the need to write complex invariants on the low-level encoding of the program as a flat transition system. Modular refinement reasoning is supported by a flexible combination of invariants, reduction, and linear permissions.

In this talk, we will report on CIVL from the perspective of verification features, programmer interaction, and the implementation atop Boogie.
