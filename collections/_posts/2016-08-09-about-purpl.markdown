**PurPL becomes a center!** Center website: [purpl.cs.purdue.edu](https://purpl.cs.purdue.edu), [full announcement](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q2/purdue-university-launches-new-research-center-on-programming-principles-and-software-systems.html), [kick-off symposium](https://purpl.cs.purdue.edu/kickoff.html).

PurPL is the cross-departmental umbrella group for programming languages research at Purdue University. PurPL research groups push the boundaries of every area in programming languages, software engineering, formal methods, and systems: PL theory, design, and implementation, language-based security, compiler optimizations, verification, program synthesis, and more. But we do more than fundamental research: we bring PL ideas to bear on a wide range of areas, including big data, security, education, and computational science.
